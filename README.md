# Block Systems

## Description

3D Game Engine/Gameplay Engine built in C++ using OpenGL. Originally a personal project kept local and private.

Extends from [nx-engine](https://github.com/forenoonwatch/nx-engine) and [ocean-rendering](https://github.com/forenoonwatch/ocean-rendering)

## Background

Building on my rough formulations of wanting to make a naval-oriented game, I originally attempted a block-based game before scrapping it. Within this project are calculations for voxel based buoyancy physics, attempts at networking, as well as other various extensions of ocean rendering and my underlying nx-engine.

Started in September of 2019 and worked on until around August of 2020, this project overlaps heavily with [nx-engine](https://github.com/forenoonwatch/nx-engine).

## Building / Usage

Uses GCC and GNU Make. Good luck.

## Future Work

A better engine and better systems
